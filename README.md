# Car-Washer

The model of the car wash represents an automatic car wash system, such as those usually found at service stations. 
In the model the washing elements are fixed, while the vehicle is dragged through a conveyor belt. 

In this project, I code the control of: 
- six engines
- twelve sensors of type optical barrier
- four sensors of type microswitch mechanical 
- three leds 

In order to simulate the use of several vehicles of the model. For this, I use a microprocessor (atmega2560) to control all devices.
