# Car-Washer
The model of the car wash represents an automatic car wash system, such as those usually found at service stations. 
In the model the washing elements are fixed, while the vehicle is dragged through a conveyor belt. 
In this project, I code six engines, twelve sensors of type optical barrier, four sensors of type 
microswitch mechanical and three leds to simulate the use of several vehicles of the model. For this, 
I use a microprocessor (atmega2560) to control all devices.
